    Image location updates to an image not in status
    ``active`` or ``queued`` can introduce race
    conditions and security issues and hence a bad
    experience for users and operators. As a result,
    we have restricted image location updates in this
    release. Users will now observe the following:

    * HTTP Response Code 409 (Conflict) will be returned
      in response to an attempt to remove an image
      location when the image status is not ``active``
    * HTTP Response Code 409 (Conflict) will be returned
      in response to an attempt to replace an image
      location when the image status is not ``active`` or
      ``queued``
