  - All ``qemu-img info`` calls will be run under resource
    limitations that limit the CPU time and address space
    usage of the process if oslo.concurrency is at least
    version 2.6.1. ``qemu-img info`` calls are now limited
    to 2 seconds and 1 GB respectively. This addresses the
    bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/+bug/1449062

    Current usage of "qemu-img" is limited to Glance tasks.
    In the Mitaka release, tasks by default will only be
    available to admin users. In general, we recommend that
    tasks only be exposed to trusted users, even in releases
    prior to Mitaka.
