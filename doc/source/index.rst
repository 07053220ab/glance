Welcome to Glance's documentation!
==================================

Glance provides an image registration and discovery service (Parallax) and
an image delivery service (Teller). These services are used in conjunction
by Nova to deliver images from object stores, such as OpenStack's Swift
service, to Nova's compute nodes.
