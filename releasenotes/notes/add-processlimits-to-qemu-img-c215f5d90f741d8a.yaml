  - All ``qemu-img info`` calls are now run under resource
    limitations that limit the CPU time and address space
    usage of the process running the command to 2 seconds
    and 1 GB respectively. This addresses the bug
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/+bug/1449062

    Current usage of "qemu-img" is limited to Glance tasks.
    In the Mitaka release, tasks by default will only be
    available to admin users. In general, we recommend that
    tasks only be exposed to trusted users, even in releases
    prior to Mitaka.
