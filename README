======

Glance is project that defines services for discovering, registering,
retrieving and storing virtual machine images. The discovery and registration
responsibilities are handled by the `glance-registry` component while the
retrieval and storage responsiblities are handled by the `glance-api`
component.

Included in the Glance project are reference implementations of the registry
(`glance-registry`) and delivery service (`glance-api`).


Quick Start
-----------

You can fetch the source from tarball by running::

    wget http://launchpad.net/glance/bexar/0.1.7/+download/glance-0.1.7.tar.gz


If you'd like to run trunk, you can fetch from the bzr repo::

    bzr branch lp:glance


Install Glance by running::

    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install


Once installed, you will need to initialize the registry database::

    glance-manage db_sync


By default, `glance-registry` will use a SQLite database. If you'd like to use
MySQL, or make other adjustments, you can modify the glance.cnf file (see
documentation for more details).


Now that Glance is configured, you can start the service.  The easiest way to
do that is by using the `glance-combined` utility which runs both the
`glance-api` and `glance-registry` services (you'll either want to run this in
screen or use the --daemonize option)::

    glance-combined


Once both services are running, you can now use the `glance-upload` tool to
register new images in Glance.

    glance-upload --type=machine --kernel=1 --ramdisk=2 myimage.img "MyImage"


With an image registered, you can now configure your IAAS provider to use
Glance as its image service and begin spinning up instances from your
newly registered images.
