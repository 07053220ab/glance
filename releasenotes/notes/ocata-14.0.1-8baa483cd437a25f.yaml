    This point release contains minor changes to keep the Ocata release
    of Glance stable with respect to current operating system packages.
fixes:
  - |
    Changes in Python 2.7 distribution packages affected Glance's use
    of eventlet.  As a result, the team backported a fix from eventlet
    0.22.0 to the Glance code.  (The Ocata release of OpenStack uses
    eventlet 0.19.0.)  See Bug 1747305_ for details.
