issues:
  - |
    'enabled_import_methods' is ListOpt type config option. If only one method
    is enabled, the format needs to be ['method'] this is not obvious as even
    the example does not have the '[' and ']' boundaries around the default
    value.
  - |
    If signature verification fails upon creation, the image data will stay
    in the backend even though the image goes to 'killed' state. The data
    remains even if a user deletes the killed image record.
critical:
  - |
    Image Import API failure with PY35 has been fixed.
  - |
    Image Import method 'web-download' failure when 'node_staging_uri' ends
    with '/' has been fixed.
  - |
    Image Import call accepting all implemented methods instead of configured
    ones has been rectified. It only accepts import calls for the methods
    listed in the config option 'enabled_import_methods'
